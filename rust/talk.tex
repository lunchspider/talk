\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
    Rust was created as a replacement of CPP.

    OOP is "Compile-time hiearchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model" - Casey Muratori
    % This dicates the boundaries of code.
    % Some type of encapsulation makes one type fo code easy to write and one type of code
    % harder to write.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    Now I was trying to create of encapsulation of domain model into traits.
    That caused too much issue.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    Culling is selecting of ?good? images.
    The definition of good/bad is judged by multiple factor, but for the sake of this 
    presentation we take every image, then run ML models on them get scores, and run 
    algorithm on them to get selection/rejections.

\begin{frame}
 a smallest \& wrong diagram of our code structure looks like this,
 remind you this is of only one pipeline, each pipeline has a seperate
 structure like this, this causes massive code duplication.

\begin{frame}
    This in term made very brittle and hard to reason about, any change and addition
    to the feature or code required writing something horrendeous like this, or simply 
    use a dozen of macros and work in together.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    Even with the macros,composing features was difficult
